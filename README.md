### Hi there 👋, I'm Agustín Iabichella Robert
#### Full-Stack Dev eager to learn
⭐A little about me:
    ☄️ Full-stack Developer with front-end orientation, passionate about developing projects that are different from the rest and scalable over time.

 🛸My career:
   ☄️ I started as a fashion photographer specialized in editorial publishings while at the same time studying for my Film degree. I had the opportunity to develop my soft skills by working and organizing large work groups and I was also sharpening aesthetic notions that contribute to my creativity to solve problems by developing.
        I am currently  finishing Henry bootcamp where I was able to acquire the necessary tools to convert my needs and those of my acquaintances into solutions with code.

 👽 What makes me different?
 ☄️ In addition to having lateral thinking to solve problems thanks to my experiences in other artistic fields, I am also extremely curious to learn and continue improving both my tech skills and my soft skills. On the other hand, as a non-binary queer person I feel like I can bring a fresh perspective to conventionally traditional spaces. 🏳️‍🌈
